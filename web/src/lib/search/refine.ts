 * Whether a run of `candidate` can continue one of `base`: an identical depth
 * and challenge set, world conditions (the blacksmith flags and the
 * Wandmaker filter) at least as strict as the base's, and every base
 * requirement covered by a
 * distinct candidate requirement at least as strict — equal, added-to, or
 * strengthened (a named item where the base wanted any of its kind, a
 * tightened bound). Only then are the base run's matches guaranteed
 * to contain every candidate match in the already-scanned region, which is
 * what makes filter-and-resume sound.
 *
 * Equality is deliberately included, not an edge case: an unchanged query
 * describes the identical world set, so the coverage argument holds and the
 * filter phase trivially keeps every previous match. That is what lets a
 * cancelled search be resumed by pressing Start again — results only ever
 * disappear when the query genuinely changes, or on an explicit clear.
 *
 * The rule itself lives in the engine and is shared with every other
 * frontend; this only feeds it the two documents. A query the engine cannot
 * decode continues nothing: an invalid query has no world set to compare, so
 * the only sound answer is a fresh scan. The UI never starts one anyway.
