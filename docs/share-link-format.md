# Share-link format

Every Seed Seeker frontend can encode the current search query as a short
shareable link, and populate its query editor from such a link. The canonical
link form is

```
https://shpd-seed-seeker.web.app/#q=EAGWhMA
```

where the value after `#q=` is a base64url code carrying the whole query. The
web app reads the fragment on load; Android opens these links natively via
App Links; the desktop apps register the `seedseeker://` URI scheme
(`seedseeker://q/CODE`) and also accept pasted web links. Decoders take the
code from a `q=` parameter introduced by `#`, `?`, or `&` (ending at the next
`&` or `#`), from the last path segment of a `seedseeker://` URI, or from bare
code text.

The canonical implementation and its compatibility tests live in
`crates/seedfinder-core/src/deep_link.rs`, reached from the web app through
WebAssembly and from the macOS and Windows apps through the C FFI
(`seedfinder_share_encode` / `seedfinder_share_decode`). Android re-implements
the codec in Kotlin and pins it against the same frozen fixtures.

## Payload

The code is base64url (`A–Z a–z 0–9 - _`, no padding) over a bit stream
written most-significant-bit first; unused bits in the final byte are zero.
Decoders reject codes with eight or more leftover bits, nonzero padding, or
values outside the ranges below, then validate the decoded query exactly like
a results-file import.

Optional fields are guarded by a presence bit: `1` means the field's value
bits follow immediately, `0` means the field takes its default and no value
bits are written.

### Header

| Field | Bits | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | 4 | Format version. This document describes version `1`. Decoders must reject other versions (telling the user the link may come from a newer release), and encoders must never renumber or reorder anything within a version. |
| `require_blacksmith` | 1 | Query flag. |
| `exclude_blacksmith_rewards` | 1 | Query flag. |
| `fast_mode` | 1 | Query flag. |
| `max_depth` | 1 (+5) | Present only when not the default 24. Value is `max_depth − 1` (floors 1–24). |
| `challenges` | 1 (+9) | Present only when nonzero. The upstream challenge bitmask: bit 0 `on_diet` … bit 8 `badder_bosses`, in the order of `CHALLENGE_NAMES` in `json_query.rs`. |
| `wandmaker_quest` | 1 (+2) | Present only when the search filters on a Wandmaker variant. Value is the SSF8 quest id minus one: `0` corpse dust · `1` elemental embers · `2` rotberry. `3` is invalid. |
| requirement count | 6 | Number of requirement records that follow (at most 63). |

### Requirement record

| Field | Bits | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | 3 | `0` weapon · `1` melee_weapon · `2` thrown_weapon · `3` armor · `4` wand · `5` ring. |
| `item` | 1 (+7) | Item code: index into the frozen item table (88 entries today). |
| `tier` | 2 (+3) | Mode `0` any (no value bits) · `1` exact · `2` at_least · `3` at_most, then the tier value. |
| `upgrade` | 2 (+3) | Mode `0` any (no value bits) · `1` exact · `2` at_least, then the upgrade value. Mode `3` is invalid. |
| `effect` | 1 (+5) | Effect code: index into the weapon-effect table for weapon kinds, the armor-effect table for armor. Invalid for wands and rings. |
| `uncursed` | 1 | Requirement flag. |
| `source` | 1 (+5) | Source code: index into the frozen source table (17 entries). |
| `identity_group` | 1 (+8) | Same-item group. The field is eight bits wide, but like the results-file format only groups 1–4 (the editors' A–D) are accepted; 0 and 5–255 are invalid. |
| `max_depth` | 1 (+5) | Value is `depth − 1` (floors 1–24). |

### Code tables

The item, effect, and source tables are **append-only**: positions are part
of the persisted format and must never change, because links shared today
must keep decoding in every future release. The authoritative tables — and
the tests that freeze them — are `ALL_ITEM_IDS`, `SOURCE_CODES`, and the
`code_tables_are_frozen` test in `crates/seedfinder-core/src/deep_link.rs`.
Effects use the wire-name order of `ALL_WEAPON_EFFECTS` / `ALL_ARMOR_EFFECTS`
in `catalog.rs` (21 entries each). If the game ever adds items, they get
fresh codes at the end of the table; existing codes stay put.

## Shared fixture

Every platform pins this vector:

- Query document: `{"requirements":[{"item":"wand_fireblast","kind":"wand","upgrade":{"at_least":3}}]}`
- Code: `EAGWhMA`
- Link: `https://shpd-seed-seeker.web.app/#q=EAGWhMA`

Encoding validates the query first, so a produced link always decodes;
decoding returns the canonical query document (defaults omitted, `kind`
spelled out).
