# Share-link format

Every Seed Seeker frontend can encode the current search query as a short
shareable link, and populate its query editor from such a link. The canonical
link form is

```
https://shpd-seed-seeker.web.app/#q=QAMtCYAA
```

where the value after `#q=` is a base64url code carrying the whole query. The
web app reads the fragment on load; Android opens these links natively via
App Links; the desktop apps register the `seedseeker://` URI scheme
(`seedseeker://q/CODE`) and also accept pasted web links. Decoders take the
code from a `q=` parameter introduced by `#`, `?`, or `&` (ending at the next
`&` or `#`), from the last path segment of a `seedseeker://` URI, or from bare
code text.

The canonical implementation and its compatibility tests live in
`crates/seedfinder-core/src/deep_link.rs` — it is the only implementation.
The web app reaches it through WebAssembly, the macOS and Windows apps
through the C FFI (`seedfinder_share_encode` / `seedfinder_share_decode`),
and Android through JNI (`JniBindings.shareEncode` / `shareDecode` /
`shareExtract`); each platform converts between its own models and the
canonical JSON query document at that boundary.

## Payload

The code is base64url (`A–Z a–z 0–9 - _`, no padding) over a bit stream
written most-significant-bit first; unused bits in the final byte are zero.
Decoders reject codes with eight or more leftover bits, nonzero padding, or
values outside the ranges below, then validate the decoded query exactly like
a results-file import.

Optional fields are guarded by a presence bit: `1` means the field's value
bits follow immediately, `0` means the field takes its default and no value
bits are written.

### Header

| Field | Bits | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | 4 | `4` for ordinary queries, `5` when a requirement selects a trinket, `6` when auto-apply is enabled. Decoders accept 4–6; retired versions 1–3 and future versions are rejected. Existing tables and layouts are frozen. |
| `auto_apply_trinket` | 1, version 6 only | Immediately follows the version nibble. Boolean query flag; absent in versions 4–5, which default to false. |
| `require_blacksmith` | 1 | Query flag. |
| `exclude_blacksmith_rewards` | 1 | Query flag. |
| `max_depth` | 1 (+5) | Present only when not the default 24. Value is `max_depth − 1` (floors 1–24). |
| `challenges` | 1 (+9) | Present only when nonzero. The upstream challenge bitmask: bit 0 `on_diet` … bit 8 `badder_bosses`, in the order of `CHALLENGE_NAMES` in `json_query.rs`. |
| `wandmaker_quest` | 1 (+2) | Present only when the search filters on a Wandmaker variant. Value is the variant's one-based game value (`WandmakerQuestType` in `quests.rs`) minus one: `0` corpse dust · `1` elemental embers · `2` rotberry. `3` is invalid. |
| requirement count | 6 | Number of requirement records that follow (at most 63). |

### Requirement record

| Field | Bits | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | 3 | `0` weapon · `1` melee_weapon · `2` thrown_weapon · `3` armor · `4` wand · `5` ring · `6` trinket offered · `7` artifact. |
| `item` | 1 (+7) | Item code: index into the frozen item table. |
| `tier` | 2 (+3) | Mode `0` any (no value bits) · `1` exact · `2` at_least · `3` at_most, then the tier value. |
| `upgrade` | 2 (+3) | Mode `0` any (no value bits) · `1` exact · `2` at_least, then the upgrade value (up to +5 for weapons, +4 otherwise; the three-bit field predates those ceilings). Mode `3` is invalid. |
| `effect` | 2 (+5 or +32) | Mode `0` any (no value bits) · `1` one effect, then its 5-bit code · `2` any enchantment (every non-curse effect of the family, no value bits) · `3` a set, then a 32-bit mask whose bit *n* is effect code *n*. Modes 1–3 are invalid for wands and rings; a mode-3 mask must be nonzero. Mode 2 carries no codes, so a link asking for "any enchantment" means the whole family of whichever release opens it. |
| `uncursed` | 1 | Requirement flag. |
| `source` | 1 (+5) | Source code: index into the frozen source table (18 entries). |
| `identity_group` | 1 (+8) | Same-item group. The field is eight bits wide, but like the results-file format only groups 1–4 (the editors' A–D) are accepted; 0 and 5–255 are invalid. |
| `max_depth` | 1 (+5) | Value is `depth − 1` (floors 1–24). |
| `alternative_group` | 1 (+6) | Alternative-group label minus one. Records sharing a label form one "any of" slot; labels are renumbered in first-appearance order when encoding. |
| `level_sum` | 1 (+10) | Combined-level group: two bits of group label minus one (groups 1–4, the editors' A–D), then the eight-bit minimum total in levels (1–255), where a matched item counts its upgrade plus one. |
| `select_trinket` | 1, versions 5–6 only | Whether this requirement selects its offered trinket. Version 6 includes this bit even when auto-apply is disabled by explicit trinket requirements. |

### Code tables

The item, effect, and source tables are **append-only**: positions are part
of the persisted format and must never change, because links shared today
must keep decoding in every future release. The authoritative tables — and
the tests that freeze them — are `ALL_ITEM_IDS`, `SOURCE_CODES`, and the
`code_tables_are_frozen` test in `crates/seedfinder-core/src/deep_link.rs`.
Effects use the wire-name order of `ALL_WEAPON_EFFECTS` / `ALL_ARMOR_EFFECTS`
in `catalog.rs` — the game journal's order, enchantments by rarity then the
curses (27 weapon entries and 21 armor entries), re-frozen when versions 1
and 2 were retired. If the game ever adds items or effects, they get fresh
codes at the end of the table; existing codes stay put.

## Shared fixture

Every platform pins this vector:

- Query document: `{"requirements":[{"item":"wand_fireblast","kind":"wand","upgrade":{"at_least":3}}]}`
- Code: `QAMtCYAA`
- Link: `https://shpd-seed-seeker.web.app/#q=QAMtCYAA`

Encoding validates the query first, so a produced link always decodes;
decoding returns the canonical query document (defaults omitted, `kind`
spelled out).
