# Search semantics: the Target Set

Every frontend implements the same search lifecycle. The model exists so that
a user's found seeds are never thrown away by starting another search: the
only action that discards results is the explicit **Clear** button.

## Definitions

- **Target Query** — the query of the first search after boot (or after
  Clear, or the query embedded in an imported results file). It stays fixed
  until Clear or a new import.
- **Target Set** — every unique match the Target Query's traversal has
  delivered, uncapped (the display cap only limits what is listed). It grows
  when an extending search scans previously uncovered range; it never
  shrinks. The *displayed* list is capped at 1,024 rows on every platform —
  a run's full result set (survivors plus new finds) can exceed that, and
  the excess must still reach the Target Set and any later refine, just not
  the screen.
- **Target coverage** — the portion of the seed space the target traversal
  has scanned, kept as resume state (uncovered remainder). Imported results
  carry no coverage.
- **World conditions** — the query-level conditions that judge an otherwise
  unchanged world: require an accessible blacksmith, exclude the Smith
  rewards, and demand a Wandmaker quest. Switching one on, or naming a quest
  where none was demanded, only ever *removes* seeds, so one query's
  conditions can be **at least as strict** as another's: every flag the base
  sets is also set, and a base quest is demanded unchanged (an unfiltered base
  accepts any). The floor limit and challenges are not world
  conditions — they change which world is generated.
- **Continuation**: query B continues query A when the floor limit and
  challenge set are identical, B's world conditions are at least as
  strict as A's, and every
  slot of A is covered by a *distinct* slot of B at least as strict — a slot
  being one requirement, or one "any of these" group of alternatives — where
  B's slot is at least as strict when each of its members implies some
  member of A's: equal, or strengthened by an item named where A wanted any
  of its kind, a tightened upgrade/tier bound, a demanded source, a narrowed
  effect set, curse state, per-item floor limit, or a dropped alternative.
  (A plain requirement multiset superset is the special case where the
  covering requirements are equal.) A combined-level group of A must be
  carried over intact: the slots covering its members must form exactly one
  group of B, of the same size, with at least A's total — and since a
  combined-level member is optional (any subset of its group may carry the
  total), it can never cover a plain slot of A. Only then is
  every B-match inside A's covered region already in A's matches, which is
  what makes filter-and-resume sound; loosening any requirement, adding an
  alternative, or lowering a total breaks the containment and B must rescan.
  The engine owns this
  predicate — `SearchQuery::continues` in `seedfinder-core`, exposed as
  `seedfinder_query_continues` (C), `JniBindings.queryContinues` (Android)
  and `query_continues` (wasm) — and frontends should call it rather than
  re-derive it.
- **Shares an item**: some requirement of B and some requirement of A have
  the same kind, and either at least one of the two names no specific item or
  both name the same item. Scope and challenge differences are irrelevant
  here — a filter re-verifies seeds from scratch under B. The engine owns
  this predicate too — `SearchQuery::shares_item` in `seedfinder-core` — and
  frontends should call it rather than re-derive it.

## Start decision

The engine owns the whole decision below and every frontend reads it from
there: `decide_start` in `seedfinder-core` (beside the two predicates it
consults), exposed as `seedfinder_decide_start` (C),
`JniBindings.decideStart` (Android) and `decide_start` (wasm), each returning
one of the lowercase names `anchor`, `target-refine`, `target-filter`,
`continue-detached`, `detached`. Continuation is part of the answer, so a
caller must not consult the continuation predicate separately; what the
frontend still owns is executing the decision — which phases to run, what to
display, and what to keep.

When Start Search runs query `Q` and a Target exists with a non-empty Target
Set:

1. **`Q` continues the Target Query** → *target refine*: re-verify the whole
   Target Set against `Q` (filter phase), display the survivors, then always
   resume scanning the target's uncovered remainder — even when the
   survivors already fill the display cap. Each resumed scan stops after it
   accepts about `RESULT_CAP` (1,024) *new* finds, the engine's per-session
   accept cap (the cap gates claiming work, so a scan may deliver slightly
   more than the cap but is guaranteed to advance coverage — a resumed pass
   never treads water). New finds match the Target Query by construction, so
   they join the Target Set and the coverage advances; repeating an identical
   query therefore keeps growing the Target Set by roughly a cap's worth of
   seeds per run. An *unsatisfiable* refine completes instantly with its
   coverage untouched: proving no seed can match consumes none of the
   remainder, so removing the impossible requirement later resumes where the
   target actually stopped.
2. **`Q` shares an item with the Target Query and has the same automatic trinket policy** → *target filter*: re-verify
   the whole Target Set against `Q` and display the survivors. No scanning;
   the Target Set and its coverage are untouched. Because the base is always
   the full Target Set — not the last run's survivors — loosening a
   requirement brings seeds back.
3. **Otherwise (unrelated)** → *detached scan*: a fresh full-range scan whose
   results replace the display, while the Target Query/Set/coverage are kept
   untouched for later related searches. If the previous run was itself a
   detached scan that `Q` continues, continue it (filter its results, resume
   its remainder) instead of rescanning — the classic pre-Target behaviour,
   scoped to the detached thread.

With no Target (boot, after Clear, or after a failed first run), the search
is an *anchor scan*: a fresh full-range scan that, on completion or cancel,
establishes the Target Query, Target Set, and coverage. A run that fails
establishes nothing. If the Target Set is empty (an anchor that found 0),
a continuing `Q` still resumes its coverage (case 1), but any other `Q`
re-anchors instead — an empty set holds nothing worth preserving.

Displayed results are always genuine matches of the query that produced
them. After mixed refines the display is not necessarily *exhaustive* for
the covered range (a narrower query may have skipped seeds an earlier one
would have kept); the tool trades exhaustiveness for never losing results.

## Import, Clear, failure

- **Import** replaces everything: the imported query becomes the Target
  Query, the imported seeds the Target Set, with empty coverage (refines of
  an import are filter-only).
- **Clear** drops the display, the Target, and all coverage. It is the only
  way to do so.
- **Failure** leaves the Target as it was; a failed run is never a
  continuation base.

## Surfacing

The status surfaces introduced for refine progress (desktop footer/status
bar, mobile snackbar, GNOME toasts) also carry the target notes:

- Target refine / target filter reuse the existing "Verifying…", "Kept X of
  Y…", "Refined: kept X of Y" notes, with *Y = the Target Set size*.
- A detached scan announces that the query is unrelated and the earlier
  results are kept (returning on a related search), since the display and
  the Target Set diverge at that moment.

The result cap, stats box, chips, and impossible-query warning are
unchanged.

## Automatic trinket world conditions

`auto_apply_trinket` selects one initial offer before generation. The prepared
policy is part of world identity: continuation requires identical preferred
rankings (or automatic selection disabled in both queries).
Explicit trinket selection slots still must agree for continuation. Changing
automatic choices starts a detached traversal, preserving the target, even
when the queries share an item. Merely filtering the target could miss seeds
that failed under the old choice and pass under the new one.

Auto-applied matches are rechecked without the trinket. If the full query still
matches, both the world and recipe are replaced with the no-trinket result.
This cleanup does not change which initial searches succeed or their coverage.

The engine owns this decision. The web passes the exact saved choices and base
query to filter workers. The engine first replays those choices, removing
unnecessary trinkets. If a saved no-trinket recipe fails a changed automatic
query, `refine_batch` retries it with the policy's choice: stripping a trinket
for the base query must not lose a seed that needs it for a refinement. Saved
recipes that still match are retained. Manual trinket
requirements continue to use their explicit selection rules. Imports carry
no scanned coverage; their recipes continue to control scouting and export
independently of editor changes.
