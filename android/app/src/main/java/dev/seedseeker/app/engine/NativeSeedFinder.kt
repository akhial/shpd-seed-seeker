/**
 * Production adapter. The Rust library owns all worker threads and every handle it creates.
 * `close()` is mandatory and idempotence should also be enforced by Rust.
 *
 * JNI contract (all integers are signed JVM primitives; packets use unsigned big-endian fields):
 *
 * 1. `startSearch(requestBytes, workers) -> handle` creates a search or throws; `workers` is the
 *    thread count, clamped natively, with 0 or less meaning every available core.
 * 2. `poll(handle, maxResults) -> resultBytes` drains, never blocks for new results.
 * 3. `status(handle) -> long[5]` returns state, scanned, total, error, and probability bits.
 * 4. `cancel(handle)` is cooperative and safe to repeat.
 * 5. `close(handle)` joins/releases native resources and is safe after any terminal state.
 * 6. `scoutSeed(requestBytes) -> scoutBytes` generates one canonical seed through depth 24.
 * 7. `startResumedSearch(requestBytes, resumeFrom, scanLen, workers) -> handle` scans `scanLen`
 *    seeds from `resumeFrom`, wrapping at 26^9, with the same lifecycle as `startSearch`.
 * 8. `resumeHint(handle) -> long[2]` returns where and how much a follow-up traversal must
 *    scan to finish this session's coverage; exact once the session has stopped.
 * 9. `filterSeeds(requestBytes, seedValues) -> resultBytes` re-verifies numeric seed values
 *    against the full query and returns the survivors, in input order, as a result packet.
 * 10. `queryContinues(candidateBytes, baseBytes) -> boolean` reports whether the candidate query
 *    may reuse a run of the base query, throwing for an undecodable packet.
 * 11. `availableWorkers() -> int` reports the logical processors available to search workers,
 *    never less than one: the ceiling the app's worker selector offers.
 *
 * Every query-taking call receives the canonical UTF-8 JSON query document
 * (docs/results-export-format.md) that [QueryDocument] writes; an invalid document fails the
 * call exactly like a malformed packet (a zero handle or an IllegalArgumentException carrying
 * the engine's message), so queries are pre-validated locally for friendlier messages.
 * Result packet `SSR1`: magic[4], count:u16, then
 * repeated seedLength:u8, seed:ASCII. State codes are 0 running, 1 complete, 2 cancelled,
 * 3 failed. A non-zero handle is required. Scout requests use `SSQ2`, a little-endian challenge
 * mask, then the canonical UTF-8 seed. Scout packet `SSC3` contains the echoed canonical seed,
 * then the run's ring gems — twelve gem ordinals, one per ring class in catalog ring order —
 * then a quest block — questCount:u8 (0..4) of strictly ascending {quest:u8, variant:u8,
 * depth:u8} records, where quest 1..4 is ghost/wandmaker/blacksmith/imp, variants are 1-based
 * per giver, and depth must sit in the giver's floor range (2..4, 7..9, 12..14, 17..19) — and
 * finally catalog ID, depth, upgrade, flags (bit 0 cursed, bit 1 hidden in a secret room),
 * effect, source, and accessibility for every item.
 * SSC4 appends the trinket deck (count:u8 = 17, then length:u16 + UTF-8 ID per entry).
 * SSC5 appends feelingCount:u8 (0..20), then depth:u8/feeling:u8 pairs: strictly
 * ascending depths 1..24 excluding multiples of five, feeling IDs 0..7 matching
 * [FloorFeeling]. Older packets decode with an empty feeling map.
